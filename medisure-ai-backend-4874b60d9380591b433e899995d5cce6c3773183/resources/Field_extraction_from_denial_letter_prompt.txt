Dear Mr. Powell
Thank you for your claim application for an Aetna Advantage Plans for Individuals, Families, and the Self-Employed. Your claim was for your condition of having trouble breathing. Based on the documents submitted, this condition was diagnosed on May 10, 2020 and the procedure took play on August 10, 2020 under Dr. Amit Patel of the Philadelphia General Hospital. After careful review of your application, we are unable to offer coverage and have declined the claim for the following reason(s): On review of the test reports submitted, this specific procedure of septoplasty did not meet the standard of being considered medically necessary and was deemed a cosmetic procedure. Furthermore, the provider (Philadelphia General Hospital)is an out-of-network provider- based on the specifics of the Aetna Advantage Plus Plan, only procedures significantly critical to patient health can be covered out-of-network. This information may have come from your application, phone interview or medical records. Medical factors that we did not review this time may be considered.

Dear Ms. Morrison,
This is regarding your recent claim under your Cigna MD PPO.  From the medical documents and forms submitted, your claim application for treatment was considered throughly. Your condition was diagnosed on December 10, 2018 and the gastric bypass treatment started June 10, 2019 under Dr. Mark Henderson of the Good Samaritan Hospital. We regret to inform you that we are unable to cover your claim for this treatment because of the following considerations: Through careful evaluation of your medical history, your condition of diabetes was deemed self-inflicted. Aetna's doctors and in-house medical expertise concluded that based on the test results submitted, despite an early diagnosis, patient behaviour did not change. If you wish to do so, you may submit an appeal.
